 We are writing an image interface for vlm, aiding it in visual question answering tasks. 
 
 Specifically.  We offer in the form of MCP servers the following visual tools: 
 
 cropping. 
 [ocr related tools (rotating, warping an image)].
 drawing and making marks on image.
blacking out the selected area.
 generating a new cropped image
spawn a subagent. 


We will later optimize the interaction with movable cursor. But for this first implementation, all interactions are coordinate based.
